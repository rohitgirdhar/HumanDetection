I implemented a human detection algorithm, proposed by Zhu, Avidan et.al. in CVPR 2006.\r\n\r\nThe final report is available [here](https://github.com/rohitgirdhar/HumanDetection/blob/master/HumanDetection_report_RohitGirdhar.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## To run the code\r\n### Training (in matlab)\r\n```\r\ncd HumanDetection/training\r\ndet = train_detector(.001,.7,0.9,'test_pos','test_neg')\r\n```\r\nNow, det is the trained detector\r\n### Testing (in matlab)\r\n```\r\nres = detector('image filename' , det);\r\nDrawRect('image filename', res)\r\n```\r\ntester functions were used for evaluating the classifier on the standard [INRIA pedestrian dataset](http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/).\r\n\r\n"}
